# GPA Calculation Process
Step by step guide through the GPA calculation process.

* Find *total_credits*
  `( total_lab_amount * credit_per_lab )` <br/>
  Example: (5 * 3) + (2 * 1.5) = 18   (This is cse 1st semester total credit)

* Find the *weighted_result* from the student's result <br/>
  ` summation( per_course_result * credit_per_course ) + summation( per_lab_result * credit_per_lab ) ` <br/>
  Here *per_course_result* is the input you've taken from the website.

* Divide the *weighted_result* by the *total_credits* to get the final gpa <br/>
  ` Final_GPA = weighted_result / total_credits`

* Final_GPA is the desired gpa of the student!
